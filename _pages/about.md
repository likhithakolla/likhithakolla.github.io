Data-driven technologies have the capacity to transform medical care, yet the actual utility of this
transformation for patients hinges upon the responsible use of these technologies. My goal is to engineer
predictive algorithms for personalized medicine, while working closely with patients and the public to facilitate
the integration of these tools into the clinic. In pursuit of these goals, I am currently obtaining an MD
as well as a PhD in Biostatistics at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn). For my dissertation work, I am studying the reliability and implementation of risk prediction models for clinical decision-making. Prior to Penn, I completed my undergraduate studies at William & Mary in Biology and CAMS (Computational and Applied Mathematics and Statistics). Then, I spent one year at the National Institute for Deafness and other Communication Disorders, where I analyzed single-cell sequencing data to better understand the genetic machinery driving inner ear development.
